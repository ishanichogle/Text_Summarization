# Text_Summarization

The code utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform text summarization using a pre-trained model through the Transformers pipeline API. Let's break down what each part of the code does:

1. Importing the `pipeline` Function:

   ```python
   from transformers import pipeline
   ```

   - This line imports the `pipeline` function from the Hugging Face Transformers library. The `pipeline` function allows you to easily use pre-trained models for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text summarization.

2. Initializing the Summarization Pipeline:

   ```python
   summarization = pipeline("summarization")
   ```

   - Here, I created an instance of the summarization pipeline by specifying the task as "summarization" when calling the `pipeline` function. This initializes a pre-trained model and tokenizer specifically designed for text summarization.

3. Providing the Original Text:

   ```python
   original_text = """
   // enter the text you want summarized here 
   """
   ```

   - You define the `original_text` variable and place the text you want to summarize within triple quotes. This is where you should input the text you want to summarize.

4. Generating the Summary:

   ```python
   summary_text = summarization(original_text)[0]['summary_text']
   ```

   - This line uses the initialized summarization pipeline to generate a summary of the `original_text`. It calls the `summarization` function with `original_text` as input.
   - The `[0]` indexing is used because the `summarization` function returns a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about the generated summary. By selecting `[0]`, you access the first (and typically only) dictionary in the list.
   - The `'summary_text'` key is used to extract the generated summary text from the dictionary.

5. Printing the Summary:

   ```python
   print("Summary:", summary_text)
   ```

   - Finally, this line prints the generated summary text to the console.

In summary, this code leverages the Transformers library to easily perform text summarization. It initializes a summarization pipeline, takes user-provided text, generates a summary using a pre-trained model, and then prints the summary to the console. This is a convenient way to quickly generate text summaries for various applications, such as content summarization or document summarization.
